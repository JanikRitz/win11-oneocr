How to use:

The code depends on the DLLs and offline AI model, the easiest 
way is copy those files from SnippingTool folder, puts them in
the same folder of ocr.exe

includes: 

- oneocr.dll
- oneocr.onemodel
- onnxruntime.dll

On my computer the SnippingTool folder located at `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.ScreenSketch_11.2409.25.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\SnippingTool`
